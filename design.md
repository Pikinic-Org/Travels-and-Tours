# Pikinic Design System (Travel & Tours)

This is the shared Pikinic design system, copied from the main site (`pikinic.ng`, the `pikinic-site` repo), where its homepage sets the standard. Keep the two copies in step: change the system there first, then mirror it here. Section 8 lists what is specific to Travel & Tours.

## 1. Sources

- **Brand assets:** fonts, colours, the pattern and the logo come from the [brand folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aqBm27RExCFiInuA0gk20Zj3qrhcGzwW).
- **Motion reference:** GSAP (ScrollTrigger, SplitText). The services section follows GSAP's "Slides Pinning, Overscroll" demo.
- **Visual reference:** Awwwards and Pinterest. Only use them for components that need a full redesign. If a font, colour or corner change fixes a component, don't redesign it.

## 2. Rules

- **Colour split, 60 / 30 / 10.** 60% `#f6f4ef` off-white, 30% `#111111` text plus `#002f16` deep-green sections, 10% `#43c074` brand green.
- **Spacing, gaps and radius** follow shadcn conventions (4px grid, mostly `gap-3/4/6`, card padding `p-6`, `md:p-8`–`p-10`). Don't install or use shadcn itself.
- **Sentence case everywhere.** No all-caps headlines, labels, buttons or nav.
- **Never add these:** taglines or small labels above headings, coloured left or right borders on cards, AI-style decorative icons (sparkles, glowing blobs), the old pathway motif, the old square-frame grid, golden or warm paper tones, sharp 2px corners.
- **Real content only.** No invented stats, testimonials, people or destinations.

## 3. Tokens

| Role | Value | Token |
|---|---|---|
| Page background (60%) | `#f6f4ef`, the brand's own light neutral (also the logo's wordmark colour) | `neutral-50` / `background-primary` |
| Cards | `#ffffff` | `surface-primary` |
| Text and dark sections (30%) | `#111111`, `#002f16` | `neutral-900`, `green-900` |
| Accent (10%) | `#43c074` | `green-500`, always with dark text (white on it fails contrast) |
| Green text on light backgrounds | `#227a48` | `green-700` |
| Service accents | Study abroad `#2577ef`, Travel and tours `#f58634`, Stay and ride `#ffd93b`, Finance `#ff4d4d` | `blue-500`, `orange-500`, `yellow-500`, `red-500` |

- **Fonts:** Grift for headings (400–700), Nexa for body (400, 500, 700). Both load locally from `src/app/fonts/` via `src/app/fonts.ts`. Nexa has metric overrides (`ascent-override: 95%`, `descent-override: 25%`) so text sits centred in buttons and pills. Without them it sits high.
- **Radius:** `sm` 4, `md` 6, `lg` 8, `xl` 10, `2xl` 12. Buttons use `lg` (8px), cards and panels `2xl` (12px), images inside cards `xl` (10px). Use `rounded-full` only for avatars, icon circles and inline photos.
- **Type scale:** page titles `text-5xl` → `lg:text-8xl`, section titles `text-4xl` → `md:text-6xl/7xl`, all `font-semibold leading-[1.02–1.05] tracking-tight`. One accent word per headline, in `green-700` (or `green-500` on dark backgrounds).

## 4. Components

- **Button** (`src/components/ui/button.tsx`): text plus a small inline arrow. The arrow never sits in its own container, and it grows on hover. Variants: `primary` (green-500, dark text), `secondary` (outline), `inverse` (white, for dark or colour sections). Sizes: `sm` h-8/px-3, `md` h-10/px-5, `lg` h-12/px-6.
- **Inline photo** (`src/components/ui/inline-photo.tsx`): a small rounded-full photo set into a line of display type. Use it in page titles and statement paragraphs, at most three per block.
- **Brand pattern** (`src/components/ui/brand-pattern.tsx`): the pattern file from the identity pack, `public/brand/pattern.svg`, recoloured tone-on-tone. Every ring is a shade between `#002f16` and `#0c4f2c` instead of the original bright-green gradient, so it shows at full opacity without being vivid. Don't redraw it, fade it or combine it with other shapes. Use it only on `green-900` surfaces: behind the call-to-action and on the highlighted stats card (Agent fees charged).
- **Cards:** white (`surface-primary`) on the off-white page, `rounded-2xl`, no borders and no shadows.
- **Deep-green cards and the bottom call-to-action block** (the call-to-action, the highlighted stat, the About mission and founder cards, the Travel & Tours package, flight-deal and partnership cards) all use `DeepGreenBackdrop` from `src/components/ui/brand-pattern.tsx`: the brand pattern on `green-900` with a dark gradient rising from the bottom (`neutral-900` 90% → 25% → transparent), so text at the bottom stays legible. This is the one place a gradient is allowed.
- **Icons:** 24px line icons, `stroke-width 1.5`, round caps, inside a `size-12` `rounded-full` `bg-green-500/15` circle (see About → Values).
- **Full-bleed dark blocks** (call-to-action, footer, team): inset by `px-3 md:px-4` from the viewport edge, with `rounded-2xl` corners.

## 5. Page patterns (from the homepage)

1. **Hero:** left-aligned three-line title (`clamp(2.5rem, 5.5vw, 5.75rem)`), each line revealed from behind a mask. The last line cycles through the outcomes, one per service (destination, degree, new home, fresh start), with a masked vertical flip. Subcopy and a single primary button sit bottom-right beside the short last line. Below it sits **one image** in a stage pinned to the viewport. It starts framed (`inset 6% 5%`, 12px corners), opens to full bleed as you scroll, pushes in slightly, then releases into the next section.
2. **Statement:** a large paragraph in the heading font with inline photos. The second half is set in `text-tertiary`.
3. **Services:** stacked full-screen panels, one per service, each in its accent colour. Each panel pins at `bottom bottom`, then scales to 0.7 and fades while the next panel slides over it (`pinSpacing: false`). The last panel scrolls normally. Below `md` they're a plain stack of cards.
4. **Stats and testimonials:** white cards on a 4-column and 3-column grid.
5. **Call-to-action:** inset `green-900` block with the brand pattern, a centred title and `primary` + `inverse` buttons.

Inner pages open with a statement-style title (with one inline photo) and reuse the same cards, dark blocks and call-to-action.

## 6. Motion

- All motion uses GSAP (`gsap.matchMedia`) and runs only under `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`. The static layout is the fallback.
- Anything that changes layout height above a pinned section (font swap, late content) must be followed by `ScrollTrigger.refresh()`. The hero does this on `document.fonts.ready`.
- `ScrollReveal` (fade and rise on entering the viewport) is fine for ordinary blocks. Keep pinned or scrubbed effects to the hero and services.

## 7. Travel & Tours specifics

- **Service accent:** Travel & Tours owns `orange-500` (`#f58634`). Use it for the one accent phrase in the hero title ("Travel smarter."), set on the sky photo. Buttons, links and every other accent stay brand green, so the site still reads as Pikinic.
- **Hero:** the sky photo sits in an inset `rounded-2xl` frame behind a centred two-line title and the flight search bar. The section keeps `z-20` and no `overflow-hidden`, so the airport and date pickers can hang over the next section.
- **Cards without a photo** (packages, flight deals, blog posts): the API sends no image, so show the brand pattern on `green-900` instead of a stock photo. Never present a stock photo as a real route or trip.
- **Deep-green blocks** (the partnership call-to-action, the custom-package request) are inset `rounded-2xl` blocks. The partnership one carries the brand pattern.
- **Motion:** this site doesn't load GSAP. It uses the CSS `.reveal` and `ScrollReveal` entrances only, and the pinned or scrubbed effects in sections 5 and 6 belong to the main site's homepage. Add GSAP here only for a matching moment, and follow section 6 when you do.
- **Utilities kept from this site:** `.scroll-snap-row` and `.no-scrollbar` for swipeable rows, and the print styles that print only `#booking-ticket`.

## 8. Open items

- **Font licences:** the local Grift zip is a personal-use demo, and the brand sheet specifies Nexa Text (the zip has Nexa). Buy commercial licences before launch.
- **Photography:** the service images are low resolution (about 700px). Replace them with graded, consistent photos, with subjects placed to suit each layout (centred for the hero's full-bleed crop).
